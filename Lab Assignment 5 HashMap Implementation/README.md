<p>
  You are required to present a department report that accesses csv files. You must put the data on the domain composition of the objects.

  <br>
dep.csv contains the following
  <br>
deptCode, deptName, location
  <br>
IT, Information Tech, 2nd floor
  <br>
HR, Human Resource, 3rd floor
  <br>
FNC, Finance, 4th floor
  <br>
  <br>
The deptemp.csv is referenced to get the salary  of the employees per department:
  <br>
deptCode, empNo, salary
  <br>
IT, E123, 30000
  <br>
IT, E124, 45000
  <br>
IT, E125, 51000
  <br>
HR, E251, 66000
  <br>
HR, E252, 25000
  <br>
FNC, E370, 42000
  <br>
FNC, E371, 29000
  <br>
FNC, E372, 37000
<br>
<br>
To get the details of the employee you must access the emp.csv:
<br>
empNo, lastName, firstName, job
  <br>
E123, Maxwell, John, Developer
  <br>
E124, Delos Reyes, Ernesto, Analyst
  <br>
E125, Ortiz, Manuel, Tester
  <br>
E251, Natividad, Lisa, HR Manager
  <br>
E252, Rosanto, Margareth, HR Specialist
  <br>
E370, Baldo, Jason, Team Leader
  <br>
E371, Hernandez, Timothy, Junior Accountant
  <br>
E372, Cruz, Ricardo, CPA
<br><br>
You need to create objects that will handle the retrieval of the csv files to convert it into objects.  These are EmployeeDA and EmployeeDA objects.  This will be the execution of the sequence:

INSTRUCTIONS:
  <br>
  1. You are not allowed to alter the composition of the domain objects.  Stick to the design. Disregard the data in the csv if it is not necessary to the object.
  <br>
  2. Adhere to correct naming conventions in naming variables and objects.
  <br>
  3. Use hashmap as your solution to the problem.
  <br>
  4. Use the department.setDepTotalSalary() in putting the aggregated value into the object.  Do not just use the salary accumulation approach in the printing process to get the depTotalSalary.
  <br>
  5. Submit the Github solution link provided in NEUVLE.
